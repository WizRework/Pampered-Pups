          <p><b>Dee Ramos - Owner</b></p>
          <p>Dee grew up working summers at her aunt's dog grooming salon, the Clip-n-Fluff. After graduating from Miami Dade College with a degree in businss administration, Dee managed a busy veterinary clinic. Several years later, her aunt announced that she was ready to retire, and Dee jumped at the chance to take over the business. She had new ideas of her own, and her aunt was happy to see that Dee would be taking what she had started to the next level. Dee is the proud best friend to Fritz, a Wheaten Terrier, and his Tibetan Spaniel sidekick, Sam.</p>

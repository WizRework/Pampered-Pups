        <p><b>Dee and Shane,</b></p>
        <p>Angie wanted me to write and let you know how great she feels. Her hair is so smooth, and I no longer hear her toes scratching across my kitchen floor. Shane, you have such a way with animals. Angie is usually hyper and jumpy, but your calm manner made this grooming visit unlike any other. Thanks for a wonderful first visit. We are already looking forward to next month.</p>

        <p><b>Dear Dee,</b></p>
        <p>Thank you so much for keeping Patch safe and happy while I was away on business last week. I know he was happy to see me, but I could tell he had a great time at the "Fritz Ritz." I appreciate all that you and your employees did to make Patch's stay so memorable.</p>

        <p><b>Dearest Dee,</b></p>
        <p>I'm writing on behalf of my owner, Ronnie. He hasn't stopped raving about what a great time I had at the plush "Fritz Ritz." If only he knew how much running around I made you do, he might worry that maybe I wouldn't be allowed back. But, it looked as if you had as much fun as I did. See you soon!</p>

        <p><b>Dear Pampered Pups,</b></p>
        <p>I was nervous about boarding Mister Wilson at Pampered Pups. He is very reserved and particular about his surroundings. However, I was relieved at ho Attentive Carmella was with himm. Mister Wilson let his guard down and soon began to act like a "Pampered Pup." Your company slogan really says it all.</p>

        <p><b>Dear Kasey,</b></p>
        <p>I can't thank you enough for taking away any reason for worry when we had to leave Zoe with you. Mu husband and I had a great vacation, and we both appreciated you occasional text on how Zoe was doing. I even saw a photo of you and Zoe on your Facebook page. You've made loyal friends out of Zoe and me. Thanks again.</p>
